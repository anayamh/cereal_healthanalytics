# Cereal Health Score Analysis & Comparison Tool
Overview:

This project explores the nutritional content of cereals and analyzes how factors like sugar, fiber, sodium, and potassium relate to overall health and ratings. A custom Health Score was created to summarize cereal healthiness, and an interactive tool allows users to compare cereals visually.

Dataset:

File: cereal.csv - "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/semakulapaul/cereals-dataset"

Includes nutritional values, manufacturer, and consumer ratings, Invalid values (-1) were treated as missing and cleaned

Features:

Data cleaning and preprocessing, Custom health score calculation, Analysis of sugar vs. ratings, Manufacturer-level comparisons, Interactive bar chart to compare two cereals by health score

Health Score:

The health score rewards fiber, protein, potassium and penalizes sugar, fat, sodium.
Higher scores indicate healthier cereals (negative values indicate poor nutrition).

Key Insights:

Higher sugar content is associated with lower health scores and ratings. Many manufacturers offer both healthy and unhealthy cereals. A single score makes nutritional comparisons easier and more intuitive
